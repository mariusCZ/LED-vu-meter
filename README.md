# LED VU meter

This is an old project that uses pulseaudio on Linux to receive real time loudness of playing audio. It is then sent to an Arduino and is shown on WS2812 LED strips.
The project uses an Android app to control the patterns.

This project is quite old and so it might not work. Uploaded here for (possible) future references.
