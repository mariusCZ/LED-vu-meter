This is still a heavy work in progress. It'll take months.

Current features working:
Music sync (buggy, but not too badly and a bit hacky)
Manual control (super buggy, mostly since Intel Edison has a slow internet connection and because of that sockets behave weird, will move TCP socket server onto PC
later on)

On the way:
Patterns (Already got UI implemented)
Proper settings
GUI on PC to control the LEDs
Proper installation
A script/program that launches everything properly
